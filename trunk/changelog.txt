1.29.14 Version 3.5.1


	2.2.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= ADDED CUSTOM HOME MENU ITEM SUBMENUS


	1.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= entering skin into SVN (should be easer to update now)

		= cleaned up all comments that were unecessary (800kb to be exact)

		= ADDED Scripts home menu item...turned off by default for now, if you
		  would like it on the home screen go into skin settings and turn it on
		  under skin settings/home

		= FIXED custom home category favorites selection (favourites weren't 
		  showing up but now they are)

		= made FileBrowser icons view (when searching for pics) match the rest
		  of the icon view changes that I've made

		= FIXED ShutDownMenu "shutdown" button.  It wasn't working properly,
		  wasn't showing all of the shutdown times (30,60,120,custom) and now
		  has arrows when focused and also a reminder when the system will turn
		  off when this window is open

1.19.14 Version 3.5.0


	1.19.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Theme Textures (Lime VideoOSD)
		
		= Fixed a background issue in the video library where video playing in 
		  the background was causing the screen to be blank.

		= Fixed animation issues in video/music playlists where the background
  		  from the active window wasn't fading out completely

		= Added "selected" color highlighting for ViewModes/SortMethods

		= Fixed the "YEAR" sort method...actually all working properly now 

		= Fixed custom favourites - screen was blank while adding favourites to
	          custom submenus (thanks fxmech)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.18.13 Version 3.3.33


	11.18.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL COMMON VIEWS!  All LIST, ICON, and BIG-ICON views have 
		  been updated skin-wide.  Pretty much a vanity revamp for Icon and Big
		  Icon, but for all non-library LIST views I added some features that 
		  should be appealing to most.  Hide the mini list icons, added button 
		  selector color (reversable by user), and the star rating is now able to 
		  be hidden.  One note for the list views, all non-library list views
		  are linked...if you change settings in music it will carry over to 
		  programs or video etc...

		= got around to adding a highlight to the top breadcrumb bar when the 
		  system tray or home icons have focus...even I was having some troubles
		  knowing when the focus was up there and I've been modding this thing.
		  Long time coming I think ---

11.7.13 Version 3.3.32


	11.13.13 (3.3.322)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= REINSTATED and REVAMPED Showcase Split View for Movies (originally
		  in the skin but barely worked and was sluggish to the point of 
		  rediculousness).  Went through and made the animations smooth,
		  put my spin on it, and tried my best to make the trailers work better	


	11.11.13 (3.3.321)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL WIDE ICON VIEWS! (Movies,Tvshows,Episodes,Albums,Songs)
		
		= Fixed an issue with sorting...not sure what was going on (it was a
		  problem that must have existed before I even started this project).
		  I think I figured it out, maybe...maybe not

	11.7.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= I finally got sick of looking at the way the view options
		  and other library options on the top submenu were acting so I just 
		  redid all of them.  Animations are better, dialogs are better, and
      		  all in all the whole experience of using any of those options up 
		  up there are better overall  :)  Only problem I can't figure out
		  right now is how to make the labels not scroll and make sense in the
		  layout... 


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

10.29.13 Version 3.3.3
	

	11.6.13  (3.3.311)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED: Large Poster View (Movies/Seasons...only two areas it's used).
		  Plenty of options for this view too, should be able to be customized 
		  very well to a user's liking from all info to quite bare and simple 

		= Tweaked my busy anim a little bit more...still not sure about position
		  and speed/pulse/fade of animation).  Not to worry, I'll get it figured
		  out...and it's pretty neat IMO

		= Fixed a small bug with Dialog_Plugin_Settings being faded out when
        	  Progress_Dialog is visible...whoops

	11.4.13  (3.3.31)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= fixed red "global" bg...accidentally deleted the </texture> when I was
		  updating previously

		= UPDATED: ALL LIST INFO VIEWS ARE DONE (MUSIC/VIDEO LIBRARY MODE)...

		= UPDATED: MUSIC THUMBNAIL VIEW (looks super cool)

		= fixed buffer bar for DialogSeekbar...one more thing that's been 
		  buggin me for awhile now

		= fixed buffer bar for Fullscreen Movies...same as above

		= cleaned up much code base from 720p folder (I will continue doing this
		  in the hopes of adding more avail. RAM and speed skin wide)

	10.29.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= went through all "fullscreen dialogs" and made the animations and 
		  visibility correct...should be seemless at this point :)
		
		= updated themes

		= found and corrected almost every problem that's been bugging me about 
		  my work up to this point (edited 75/102 windows if that says anything)

		= revamped ShutdownMenu, DialogKeyboard, DialogSelect, NumericInput,
		  SmartPlaylistEditor/Rule, ContextMenu noticibly...many others as well

		= added navigational arrows to several windows for list's that extend 
		  their "<height>" (sorry must have never noticed those missing)		  
 		= changed many other things that I wont go into detail about, but the 
		  overall change is a major improvement toward fluency and appeal to say
		  the least...

		  also fixed several things that I missed when I first added it to my
		  zip.

		= Completely redid all of the video aspect ratio media flags (the
		  original ones just looked...well, not good to be polite)


	8.24.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Movies Fanart View, made it possible to remove the wraplist
		  and info so that only minimal "screen garbage" is visible for better
		  viewing of the fanart (that is the point right???) Click on 
		  the "View options" button, then click "hide wraplist" and enjoy!

		= Updated Video OSD so that when you click on the subtitle button when
		  video is playing it will open XBMC Subtitles (script must be installed
		  in order to work) In case anyone was wondering, the script does work...

		  InfoPane is visible

	7.29.13 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		  skin) - very plain though, accessable through "SKIN SETTINGS"

		= Completely changed HomeMenu "workings" (multilingual now :)

		= Added Dutch, French, German, Portugese, and Spanish languages!!!

		= Too many other things to go into...most other things That were changed
		  had to do with multilingual support, however I made more RAM available
		  throughout the whole skin (comparable to confluence lite for sure)

		  "numbered"

		  the issue)

		  bugs, but it works well...especially on dev. builds)

		  eachother

		  to start adding customization to home sub menus, and home menu also.

	3.3.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                = started working on turning PROFILE dialogs into "windows" to follow up
		  what I have already done with several other dialogs (similar to what I
		  did with adding a source...several dialogs that make the process of 
		  logging into xbmc4xbox turned into one "profile settings" area).  After
		  these are wrapped up I think I'll be content with that aspect of this
		  skin ---
