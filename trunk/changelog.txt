5.16.14 Version 3.5.32

	5.24.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Once again tweaked addon fanart...should be good for real 
		   now?

		=  Attempted a fix for Home Submenus, changed them from List
		   to fixedlist...now when items are removed from the subemus
		   the remaining items will all be centered instead of all
		   over to the left side of the menu.


	5.16.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Refixed addon fanart...something wasn't quite right, but
		   but now it's straightened out.

		=  Fixed a typo "Conditonal" in (pluginsettings)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

4.24.14 Version 3.5.3

	4.24.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added fanart for when browsing an addon that has background
		  art (I've meant to do that for awhile now)

		=  Fixed paths to submenu addon buttons...everything used to 
		   be linked to xbmc4xbox repo but our repo is now empty.  For
		   now these buttons will link directly into the respective 
		   xbmc.org repo categories. 

		=  Added a poster wrap view for GAMES

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

2.17.14 Version 3.5.2

	3.30.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added a "submenu filter" meaning that one can further
		  customize the submenu from skin settings by adding or 
		  subtracting individual items (or the whole submenu
		  for that matter) to their liking.  Skin settings/home/
	          submenus...only items that already exist

		= Fixed all lag in custom skin settings...I'm getting good
		  at workarounds.  This is something that's been bugging me 
		  since I started changing things with this skin.  It's now 
		  lightning fast!

		= MAJOR work has gone into SkinVariables...It has added more
		  speed, and taken away great amounts of code.

		= Added almost all breadcrumbs and system tray into includes
		  and the labels are now in skin variables...this means that
                  if for any reason someone wants to add different labels
		  button sizes etc. it will be loads easier and this also 
		  cut a ton of code out of the skin, not to mention added
		  CPU speed and increased ram

		= PICTURES and GENERAL backgrounds have been changed/updated

		= ListInfo2 views for all containers have been diminished to 
		  "Banner Style" only.  This got rid of 4 pretty useless files
		  not to mention getting rid of files that were automatically
		  included into ram every time any library container was
		  entered which = more ram saved

		= Cleaned up the Recently Added code...Didn't really change
		  the apperance of it yet but am considering it.  Also made
		  Recently Added Albums actually show ALBUMS!  For whatever
		  reason I never realized that prior to this change it was
		  actually scanning songs not albums (never really use this
		  feature so I never noticed)

		= Added MUSIC VIDEOS to the home menu, when music vids are 
		  scanned into the library this category will now show up 
		  on the home menu (also added Music Videos to the recently
		  added items on the home screen)

		= Made OSD bookmarks into a full screen dialog just as I have
		  with all the rest

		= Skin now defaults to transparent settings

		= Crushed down textures which suprisingly added more than 
		  1mb ram skinwide (home menu boots up to 40mb free and stays
		  pretty close to that skinwide with the use of ToDDs)


	3.2.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Fully integrated transparent top bar, sub-menus, home menu
		  (the option is in skin settings/general)

		= Reduced sub-menu font size slightly (adds a cleaner look,
		  still easy to read), also took away sub-menu zoom effect

		= Reduced skin settings/settings font slightly...too big and
		  now has a distinguishable size difference from the category
		  labels

		= Changed "SYSTEM" home button (settings now have categories
		  first before entering appearance settings).  Submenu
		  "settings" renamed to "appearance" which is a direct link
		  to appearance settings also submenu has been made hidden
      		  unless accesed like all other sub-menus

		= Changed "MUSIC" home button (if Library.HasContent(Music) 
		  it will now open MusicLibrary)

	2.22.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added "Constant Submenus" option for home menu (skin settings/
		  home)

		= Added Transparent Home Menu option (been a long time coming)

		= SelectDialog, Favourites, and Shutdown all have search icon when 
		  home window is active (superficial mostly)

	2.17.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Reverted custom home sub-menus (took too much ram for now...still gonna
		  figure it out hopefully)

		= Added Skin Variables -- doing this allowed me to add a bit of ram back by 
		  getting rid of a couple includes files
			
			--> Includes_BreadcrumbSettings.xml
			--> Includes_RamSavingBackgrounds.xml
			
		= Cleaned up custom submenu strings...
		
		= Fixed backgrounds for Keyboard and Select dialogs for particular situations 
		  (sometimes these windows backgrounds would be mostly transparent when they
		  weren't supposed to be)
		 
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

1.29.14 Version 3.5.1


	2.2.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= ADDED CUSTOM HOME MENU ITEM SUBMENUS


	1.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= entering skin into SVN (should be easer to update now)

		= cleaned up all comments that were unecessary (800kb to be exact)

		= ADDED Scripts home menu item...turned off by default for now, if you
		  would like it on the home screen go into skin settings and turn it on
		  under skin settings/home

		= FIXED custom home category favorites selection (favourites weren't 
		  showing up but now they are)

		= made FileBrowser icons view (when searching for pics) match the rest
		  of the icon view changes that I've made

		= FIXED ShutDownMenu "shutdown" button.  It wasn't working properly,
		  wasn't showing all of the shutdown times (30,60,120,custom) and now
		  has arrows when focused and also a reminder when the system will turn
		  off when this window is open

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

1.19.14 Version 3.5.0


	1.19.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Theme Textures (Lime VideoOSD)
		
		= Fixed a background issue in the video library where video playing in 
		  the background was causing the screen to be blank.

		= Fixed animation issues in video/music playlists where the background
  		  from the active window wasn't fading out completely

		= Added "selected" color highlighting for ViewModes/SortMethods

		= Fixed the "YEAR" sort method...actually all working properly now 

		= Fixed custom favourites - screen was blank while adding favourites to
	          custom submenus (thanks fxmech)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.18.13 Version 3.3.33


	11.18.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL COMMON VIEWS!  All LIST, ICON, and BIG-ICON views have 
		  been updated skin-wide.  Pretty much a vanity revamp for Icon and Big
		  Icon, but for all non-library LIST views I added some features that 
		  should be appealing to most.  Hide the mini list icons, added button 
		  selector color (reversable by user), and the star rating is now able to 
		  be hidden.  One note for the list views, all non-library list views
		  are linked...if you change settings in music it will carry over to 
		  programs or video etc...

		= got around to adding a highlight to the top breadcrumb bar when the 
		  system tray or home icons have focus...even I was having some troubles
		  knowing when the focus was up there and I've been modding this thing.
		  Long time coming I think ---


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.7.13 Version 3.3.32


	11.13.13 (3.3.322)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= REINSTATED and REVAMPED Showcase Split View for Movies (originally
		  in the skin but barely worked and was sluggish to the point of 
		  rediculousness).  Went through and made the animations smooth,
		  put my spin on it, and tried my best to make the trailers work better	


	11.11.13 (3.3.321)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL WIDE ICON VIEWS! (Movies,Tvshows,Episodes,Albums,Songs)
		
		= Fixed an issue with sorting...not sure what was going on (it was a
		  problem that must have existed before I even started this project).
		  I think I figured it out, maybe...maybe not

	11.7.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= I finally got sick of looking at the way the view options
		  and other library options on the top submenu were acting so I just 
		  redid all of them.  Animations are better, dialogs are better, and
      		  all in all the whole experience of using any of those options up 
		  up there are better overall  :)  Only problem I can't figure out
		  right now is how to make the labels not scroll and make sense in the
		  layout... 


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

10.29.13 Version 3.3.3
	

	11.6.13  (3.3.311)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED: Large Poster View (Movies/Seasons...only two areas it's used).
		  Plenty of options for this view too, should be able to be customized 
		  very well to a user's liking from all info to quite bare and simple 

		= Tweaked my busy anim a little bit more...still not sure about position
		  and speed/pulse/fade of animation).  Not to worry, I'll get it figured
		  out...and it's pretty neat IMO

		= Fixed a small bug with Dialog_Plugin_Settings being faded out when
        	  Progress_Dialog is visible...whoops

	11.4.13  (3.3.31)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= fixed red "global" bg...accidentally deleted the </texture> when I was
		  updating previously

		= UPDATED: ALL LIST INFO VIEWS ARE DONE (MUSIC/VIDEO LIBRARY MODE)...

		= UPDATED: MUSIC THUMBNAIL VIEW (looks super cool)

		= fixed buffer bar for DialogSeekbar...one more thing that's been 
		  buggin me for awhile now

		= fixed buffer bar for Fullscreen Movies...same as above

		= cleaned up much code base from 720p folder (I will continue doing this
		  in the hopes of adding more avail. RAM and speed skin wide)

	10.29.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= went through all "fullscreen dialogs" and made the animations and 
		  visibility correct...should be seemless at this point :)
		
		= updated themes

		= found and corrected almost every problem that's been bugging me about 
		  my work up to this point (edited 75/102 windows if that says anything)

		= revamped ShutdownMenu, DialogKeyboard, DialogSelect, NumericInput,
		  SmartPlaylistEditor/Rule, ContextMenu noticibly...many others as well

		= added navigational arrows to several windows for list's that extend 
		  their "<height>" (sorry must have never noticed those missing)		  
 		= changed many other things that I wont go into detail about, but the 
		  overall change is a major improvement toward fluency and appeal to say
		  the least...
		
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

	8.27.13

		= Went through and put the final touches on the Movies Fanart view,
		  also fixed several things that I missed when I first added it to my
		  zip.

		= Completely redid all of the video aspect ratio media flags (the
		  original ones just looked...well, not good to be polite)


	8.24.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Movies Fanart View, made it possible to remove the wraplist
		  and info so that only minimal "screen garbage" is visible for better
		  viewing of the fanart (that is the point right???) Click on 
		  the "View options" button, then click "hide wraplist" and enjoy!

		= Updated Video OSD so that when you click on the subtitle button when
		  video is playing it will open XBMC Subtitles (script must be installed
		  in order to work) In case anyone was wondering, the script does work...


	8.13.13

		= Italian and Russian strings added

		  InfoPane is visible

	7.29.13 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added "Ram-Saving" background option (1-2mb RAM gain through entire
		  skin) - very plain though, accessable through "SKIN SETTINGS"

		= Added "Universal" background option (1 BG for whole skin [user define])
		
		= Completely changed HomeMenu "workings" (multilingual now :)

		= Added Dutch, French, German, Portugese, and Spanish languages!!!

		= Too many other things to go into...most other things That were changed
		  had to do with multilingual support, however I made more RAM available
		  throughout the whole skin (comparable to confluence lite for sure)

		  (depreciated for frodo)

		= corrected all "skin" strings labels so now all labels are correcly
		  "numbered"

		= wasted $100 on font editing software that did NOTHING

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

5.24.13 Version 3.2.83

	5.24.13

		= fixed a bug in skin settings for custom BG file exploring (sorry, but
		  if people don't point out these things it's left up to me to discover
		  when I stumble upon it.  If you use the skin and notice something's 
		  wierd, don't be bashful...post on the forum and I will quickly address
		  the issue)

		= still majorly working on language...this is the reason for the delay in
		  development of other parts of this skin (what a pain in the ass)

4.16.13 Version 3.2.82

		  is now the option of adding anything from your favourites to the 
		  "home menu" simply by browsing from skin settings/cutom home cat's/...
		  and setting the buttons up the way that you want them. (Might be a few
		  bugs, but it works well...especially on dev. builds) 

		= fixed a bug in File Manger where the number of items were overlaying
		  eachother

		= Added path info for File Browser (not sure why I never added it...)  

		= started to integrate Dom's content.search.py (at jan's request) and
		  that will be the next addition coming very soon

		= changed Home.xml...added scroll indicators to sub menus.  Getting ready
		  to start adding customization to home sub menus, and home menu also.  
		  Going to start with subs first (Music already has too many items for 
		  the space allowed, so that's an improvement right off the bat)


	3.3.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= **FIXED** issue with black screen on skin change has been resolved

		= took care of the submenubar being visible at the bottom of the screen
		  occasionally (been bugging me since I started working on this skin)


	3.2.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= revamped numericimput (that STUPID annoying script alert is next!!!)

		  now (will make it change with the rest of the custom top bar soon!)


                = started working on turning PROFILE dialogs into "windows" to follow up
		  what I have already done with several other dialogs (similar to what I
		  did with adding a source...several dialogs that make the process of 
		  logging into xbmc4xbox turned into one "profile settings" area).  After
		  these are wrapped up I think I'll be content with that aspect of this
		  skin ---

	2.24.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		  and Master Profile buttons visible on the menu (the entire login

	2.11.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= cleaned up more includes (hardly any left)
		= got rid of Dimming option in skin settings (+ more)

		  --> deleted several platform "dependencies" that were not necessary
		  --> closer to a SOLID 42mb RAM avail on startup (still a bit shy)
		  --> started messing around with a "play" button on the TopBar
		  --> still need to add submenus to other home windows...stay tuned


	2.10.13------------------------------------------------------------------------------
