9.14.15 Version 3.5.48

	9.14.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= added skin system debug/stats...put it under the top bar and 
		  not sure whether or not to make it visible during FS playback
		  (where would it go, how would it look, etc...)


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

8.2.15 Version 3.5.47

	8.27.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= MIGRATED TO GIT!


	8.2.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Fixed up script-XBMC_Lyrics-main, always worked but wasn't really up
		  to my standards of things...looks/works fine now (seek bar too!)

		= Reinvented how to install CuLrcLyrics into x4x...wrote a little script
		  that installs zips from rcm/scripts/Cu LRC Lyrics instead of relying on
		  the program to install it for me...works without a hitch


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

4.16.15 Version 3.5.46

	7.5.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Removing DialogFullscreenInfo.xml from the skin and moving all
		  releavant parts into VideoFullscreen.xml --- all other changes
		  have been made in respect to this change.  Hopefully a permanant
		  fix for all of the video problems, and they were being caused by
		  DFSI as far as I can tell.


	5.20.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		= Clearly wrong with my previous assumption, however continuing to 
		  hash out more errors I've made more progress in adding another
		  open/close animation to DialogSeekbar.xml and this seems to have
		  made the crash stop from a clean install of r149
	

	5.18.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= With almost 100% confidence I think I've got the crashes resolved - 
		  I forgot to add an open/close animation to DialogVolumeBar.xml when I 
		  started trying to fix this issue for whatever reason but adding the 
		  animation seems to have fixed the issue (fingers crossed).  If that's 
		  the case - that it was simply this missing animation - I feel the need
		  to scale back some of the desperate changes made lately...not all, but 
		  some because a pretty good hit is being taken at startup because of 
		  the includes added for this mess.
		  
	
	5.13.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Placed controls for MusicOSD/VideoOSD/PlayerControls into includes.xml
		  so that there is less to render at video startup...seems to have 
		  improved ram during playback, but small drawback of less ram at 
	          startup (.3mb altogether with recent changes from the version).  I can
		  only find a couple of files that won't play over smb on this skin that
		  will play on others so the problem isn't fixed but is mostly taken care 
		  of

		= Added window open/close animations for these media windows into 
		  includes for the same reasons
	

	5.5.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Took more things from the windows launched when a video starts
	   	  and placed them in includes in the hopes of making x4x not crash.
		  Seems to be working...	

	5.1.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Placed DialogFullscreenInfo.xml/PlayerControls.xml media flags into 
		  includes.xml in hopes of having a smoother transition into a playing 
		  video...gotta help since it's one less big chunk of stuff to be loaded
		  when a video starts up


	4.27.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= ADDED a setting in skin settings (default as of right now) that
		  disables all home menu custom settings...this Home.xml is only half
		  of what it is with all of the strings for custom settings, and I think 
		  the size (possibly the amount of different strings?) in guisettins.xml
		  are causing problems with video playback for this skin. 
	

	4.24.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added the ability to change/disable the start up tone.  When choosing
		  a new sound the selection starts in MusicPlaylists, however these 
		  don't work on startup for some reason (not my fault).  Any music file
		  can be selected from here though, and will be played at the start of
		  an x4x session.


	4.19.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Changed VideoFullscreenInfo.xml to have the action icon/labels instead
		  of the normal seekbar...more in line with what I've implemented with 
		  other windows to this point.  Kinda choppy, but slippery so might 
		  just settle with what I've got here (r191)

	4.15.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added Progress-Cache-Bar to all appropriate windows...must have
		  accidentally deleted this?

		= Added a "plugins" button to home MUSIC submenu


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

12.27.14 Version 3.5.45

	2.11.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= FIXED	A MAJOR ISSUE (I think) - starting a video no longer crashes
		  an xbmc4xbox session! Not sure if anyone else is experiencing this
		  but something that I did over the holidays made the xbox crash when 
		  a video started (almost every time).  Added window open/close 
		  animations to all of the windows involved with videos starting and
		  that seems to have fixed the problem as far as I can tell...

		= FIXED missing brackets in <visible> tags for all windows that have
		  infopane and sort-letter...this had to be throwing some sort of 
		  error at some point durring any session while using this skin whether
		  or it was major or not. 

		= FIXED an issue with seekbar not displaying labels properly.


	12.31.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Font.xml and added DefaultFont for all fonts that were
		  missing in all xml files...now there are no <font> names that
		  are not in Font.xml - This pretty much wraps up the clean up that
		  I was doing.


	12.27.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Used the Skin XML Converter by phil65 and found several attributes
		  and values that were throwing errors in 90% of files...fixed em up.

		= Changed <textureradionofocus>/<textureradionofocus> to 
		  <textureradioon>/<textureradiooff>

		= Replaced a few includes and deleted them from includes.xml

		= Added a border to focused item in Wall View (Movies)



ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

12.12.14 Version 3.5.44


	12.25.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added seekbar to topbar area when non media windows are visible...
		  not much of an upgrade, but necessary since the option to do so
	          is available in any window when media is playing.

		= TAGGING 3.5.44


	12.21.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added a new disc image for the spinning CD/CdArt...also added a couple
		  options (made a specific category for this) - to slow it down, or to
		  stop it...gearing this towards a user that has CdArt and wants to be
		  able to see the disc cover moving at a reasonable rate...looks nice.
		  Also for those that like the look of the old "lightscribe" disc there
		  is also an option to switch to that disc as well under :Show front of
		  disc:


	12.19.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Scaled back busy animation...amazing what removing 10kb of a .png 
		  will do for not crashing this program during a crutial process... 


	12.18.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED Home NowPlaying...got rid of the old slide out box with
		  limited space and changed to what I've done with (PlayerControls).
		  There is an option to align this on the top or the bottom in skin
		  settings (default is bottom) under SKIN SETTINGS/HOME/NOW PLAYING...


		 ***************** NOT VISIBLE WHEN MEDIA IS PLAYING ***************

		= Straightened out System Info panel on Home Window

		= Added a Weather Info Panel on Home Window (same thing as System
		  Info except weather data is displayed)

		= Dropped recently added menu down to the same spot as System/Weather
		  widgets...should add a tad bit more uniformity.  
			
		 *******************************************************************


		= Fixed DialogVolumeBar.xml to show the big bar when (PlayerControls) is
		  on the screen

		= Deleted includes_OSDNotifications.xml - zero reasons to keep it


	12.12.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Cleaned up Font.xml - it only affected 90% of the files :| 
		  In doing this (cutting the size of the file in half) it freed
		  up .6 MB of RAM...I was actually a little surprised because
		  I honestly was thinking it would be significantly more.  It's
		  enough of a difference to commit it though, I'll take what I 
		  can get out of this thing...

		= Fixed Profiles BreadCrumb label (from "favourites")

		= Quick fix for home system info...gave me some good ideas for
		  the entire home menu theme and other things (not commited)


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.29.14 Version 3.5.43

	12.11.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= REVAMPED (PlayerControls)...looks good and works properly

		= Changed FullScreenInfo and Viz ShowInfo to match what I did with
		  (PLayerControls)

		= Made Changes to Video/MusicOSD to follow suit with what I 
		  changed from (PlayerControls)...It looks really nice now
		  that there's congruency between all of these media windows.

		= Added the ability to change the OSD backing color (gray,theme,
		  theme 2) from skin settings

		= Fixed a bug with coverflow images being visible when entering 
		  containers while the view isn't visible (mostly when progress 
		  dialog is visible)


	12.5.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Removing all RCB fonts originally added to font.xml - it was
		  ultimately not needed (rcb works with out this) and it was
		  snatching 1.5mb of RAM at startup...glad I caught this, and
		  this also opens my eyes to cleaning up font.xml because there
		  are many fonts of the same style and type with different names.
		  Perhaps by unifying these I'll be able to gain a decent amout
		  of RAM back that otherwise would be wasted due to sloppy 
		  coding.


	11.30.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added an option to change the volume display size for 
		  fullscreen media (for Oldxboxusa)

		= Added G Drive to the center column in (FileManger)


	11.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		= Wasn't my intention to start with this...but I finally think
		  I figured a way to make all of the fluff from programs views
		  disappear when window loads with progress dialog visible. 
  		  Not very exciting to most I'm sure...but I've been trying to 
		  figure this out for a REALLY long time (stringcompare the 
		  veiw's label!)

		= Added RCB into skin/scripts...figured out how to hack the labels
		  to show up finally by adding the strings (original string id's
	   	  in tact) into my skin's strings.xml's - also added the fonts
		  (.ttf) + the font code into my skin's Font.xml

		= Added R.C.B. onto PROGRAMS submenu...runs the script right from
		  home.  Also made Apps and Emus not visible on program's 
		  submenu (default)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.19.14 Version 3.5.42

	11.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		= Changed Label fading time (CoverFlow) when InfoPane isn't 
		  visible...no reason to have a delay when switching items 
		  imo...thought originally that it would help smoothness, not
		  the case.  I'm not sure anything can help smoothness with
		  64mb RAM and a lame processor with that much going on 
		
		= Made a hack with the seekbar...been trying to figure this
		  out for a looooooong time, slider now works in FullScreen-
		  videoInfo without the whole seekbar entourage being visible.
		  I gotta pat myself on the back for this one, next step is 
		  to transfer this into HomeNowPlaying and PlayerControls
	

	11.27.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		= CoverFlow should be wrapped up at this point unless I missed 
		  something

		= Added an experimental wide icon view to games

		= fixed a bug with the list view jumping when upper menu is 
		  accessed (problem with the scrollbar id)
	
		= made a quick fix for Now Playing Music when spinning cd isn't
		  visible

	11.27.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		= added a Poster style icon option for CoverFlow in pictures, 
		  videos, scripts and programs

	11.25.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added CoverFlow view to VideoLibrary (Movies,TvShows,Seasons,
		  Sets)

		= Added CoverFlow view to Programs, Scripts, Pictures, Videos...
		  I'm still uncertain of a couple of things (label visible while
		  infopane is?), and before I push another release I would like
		  to possibly add a "tall" option for programs (games).  This 
		  view is pretty well wrapped up for now


	11.20.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added a skin settings option for switching to a higher 
		  background resolution...most of the code was added into
		  includes and surprisingly it didn't really impact RAM
		  usage all that much.  In fact it appears at first glance
		  that when backing out to the home screen RAM usage is 
		  less than before I implemented this.  Same backgrounds,
		  except at 960x540 resolution...
		
		= Fixed a bug with pictures backgrounds not un-dimming 
		  when told to do so
	
		= Found and fixed the overly dark background dimming for 
		  list view in (videolibrary)

		= Added a skin setting for dimming or un-dimming home
		  window backgrounds (default's to dim)


	11.19.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added CoverFlow view into all music containers...Now that I've
	   	  got a template that works, it shouldn't take long for the rest
		  of the containers that I want to add this view into.  Started 
		  with what I backported form Transparency (x4x) and fine tuned
		  it from there making it pretty much my own (thx to ronie for
		  the original view, the cdcase, and the reflection diffuse)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

10.21.14 Version 3.5.41

	11.11.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Made many changes in (Programs), fixed Icon view (I'll be
		  implementing this in all of the other Icon views skinwide),
		  fixed LargePoster Resolution to be exact to 5x7.

		= Changed the gloss overlay animation in LargePoster so it 
		  disappears immediately. 

		= Reproduced Icon veiw from what I did in programs through all
		  of the other 9 times this view is active in main windows...
		  got rid of about 900 lines of garbage code in the process.
		  

	11.5.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Fixed a bug with a Large Poster texture showing up every time
		  a4x installer opened from home menu

		= Completely remade TextViewer.xml to a fullscreen dialog...
		  it looks pretty now

	11.1.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Changed Large Poster (Programs) to work in all programs 
		  windows (not just games anymore).  Suggestion would be to
  		  use this view only in containers where thumbs are readily
		  available...otherwise it becomes difficult to use if the 
                  folder icons are the only thing that's visible (list view
		  would be better for these containers)


	10.25.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= (MusicFiles) and (Programs) are now set up to work with List
		  View extra media...however I can't figure out anything that 
		  works to put in the box at this point.  At least it's set up
		  to work at this point from Custom View Options and will be 
		  easily implimented when ready.

		= Added fanart to DialogVideoInfo

		= Fixed a bug with (FileBrowser) and (ContextMenu) being visible
		  at the same time.

		= Added DialogReopInfo.xml to the skin...looks like all of the 
		  other media info windows for the most part, not sure what to 
		  do with it at this point since I'm not sure how much of it 
		  works as far as the "List of Built in Controls" is concerned.
		  This will need to be revisited eventually, but it works with 
		  the skin better than the default one that's packaged with a4x
		  installer.
	

	10.21.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= started making changes to the standard list view...some media
		  info now automatically pops up when available (videofiles). 
		  The goal is to spread this trough all of the list views that 
		  have some sort of media info available so this will be a work 
		  in progress. 	
	
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

10.14.14 Version 3.5.4

	10.14.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Overhauled both Video/Music OSD icons and control structure.
		  This is much cleaner looking and way easier for someone
		  that's never used xbmc to understand.  Also updated all
		  corresponding windows that extend from these menus to match
		  the other fullscreen dialogs that I've been implementing for 
		  some time now...

		= Added a debug sub-menu item to systems sub-menu.  This makes
		  the process of entering debug logging much less of a headache,
		  especially for the noob

		= Added much support for games...apparently there was none before
		  I started updating this section (TrainerSettings.xml and
		  GameSaves.xml have been added)

		= Added programs to the system settings menus and sub-menus

		= Added full support for lyrics...when the lyrics/subtitles button
		  is clicked (and the scripts are not installed), the skin will 
		  install automatically for you.  As for lyrics, I made the	
		  script-XBMC_Lyrics-main.xml from scratch so that when using 
		  lyrics it's a much cleaner looking and easy to read experience

		= Fixed the "BROWSE" button for (NetworkSetup).  Still needs to
		  be revisited at some point but is working well enough for now.

		= Fixed numerous breadcrumb labels that were either cut off or
		  not working for their specified containers...it'll take time
		  to get them all ironed out, but I'll keep plugging along

		= Changed (PluginSettings) spincontrolex button to match the
	          the rest of the other buttons.  Don't know why I never noticed
		  that it was different.

		= Fixed missing xbmc4xbox colored NoFocus icons on homescreen

		= Fixed the messed up menu in DialogAlbumInfo.xml - also changed
		  the way that the window closes and also made the top bar's in
		  all of these media info windows un-navigable (added too much
		  confusion).  Also added fanart into all of these windows...

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

5.16.14 Version 3.5.31

	5.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Hid a couple of residual images that are showing in PROGRAMS
		   from what should only be visible in games container.  When
		   a4x installer is hanging they were showing up but not any
		   more

	5.25.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Added a button to SYSTEM sub-menu that can enable/disable
		   Debug logging straight from the home menu instead of 
		   navigating to home/system settings/debug...I was getting 
		   sick of doing it :/

	5.24.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Once again tweaked addon fanart...should be good for real 
		   now?

		=  Attempted a fix for Home Submenus, changed them from List
		   to fixedlist...now when items are removed from the subemus
		   the remaining items will all be centered instead of all
		   over to the left side of the menu.


	5.16.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		=  Refixed addon fanart...something wasn't quite right, but
		   but now it's straightened out.

		=  Fixed a typo "Conditonal" in (pluginsettings)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

4.24.14 Version 3.5.3

	4.24.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added fanart for when browsing an addon that has background
		  art (I've meant to do that for awhile now)

		=  Fixed paths to submenu addon buttons...everything used to 
		   be linked to xbmc4xbox repo but our repo is now empty.  For
		   now these buttons will link directly into the respective 
		   xbmc.org repo categories. 

		=  Added a poster wrap view for GAMES

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

2.17.14 Version 3.5.2

	3.30.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added a "submenu filter" meaning that one can further
		  customize the submenu from skin settings by adding or 
		  subtracting individual items (or the whole submenu
		  for that matter) to their liking.  Skin settings/home/
	          submenus...only items that already exist

		= Fixed all lag in custom skin settings...I'm getting good
		  at workarounds.  This is something that's been bugging me 
		  since I started changing things with this skin.  It's now 
		  lightning fast!

		= MAJOR work has gone into SkinVariables...It has added more
		  speed, and taken away great amounts of code.

		= Added almost all breadcrumbs and system tray into includes
		  and the labels are now in skin variables...this means that
                  if for any reason someone wants to add different labels
		  button sizes etc. it will be loads easier and this also 
		  cut a ton of code out of the skin, not to mention added
		  CPU speed and increased ram

		= PICTURES and GENERAL backgrounds have been changed/updated

		= ListInfo2 views for all containers have been diminished to 
		  "Banner Style" only.  This got rid of 4 pretty useless files
		  not to mention getting rid of files that were automatically
		  included into ram every time any library container was
		  entered which = more ram saved

		= Cleaned up the Recently Added code...Didn't really change
		  the apperance of it yet but am considering it.  Also made
		  Recently Added Albums actually show ALBUMS!  For whatever
		  reason I never realized that prior to this change it was
		  actually scanning songs not albums (never really use this
		  feature so I never noticed)

		= Added MUSIC VIDEOS to the home menu, when music vids are 
		  scanned into the library this category will now show up 
		  on the home menu (also added Music Videos to the recently
		  added items on the home screen)

		= Made OSD bookmarks into a full screen dialog just as I have
		  with all the rest

		= Skin now defaults to transparent settings

		= Crushed down textures which suprisingly added more than 
		  1mb ram skinwide (home menu boots up to 40mb free and stays
		  pretty close to that skinwide with the use of ToDDs)


	3.2.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Fully integrated transparent top bar, sub-menus, home menu
		  (the option is in skin settings/general)

		= Reduced sub-menu font size slightly (adds a cleaner look,
		  still easy to read), also took away sub-menu zoom effect

		= Reduced skin settings/settings font slightly...too big and
		  now has a distinguishable size difference from the category
		  labels

		= Changed "SYSTEM" home button (settings now have categories
		  first before entering appearance settings).  Submenu
		  "settings" renamed to "appearance" which is a direct link
		  to appearance settings also submenu has been made hidden
      		  unless accesed like all other sub-menus

		= Changed "MUSIC" home button (if Library.HasContent(Music) 
		  it will now open MusicLibrary)

	2.22.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Added "Constant Submenus" option for home menu (skin settings/
		  home)

		= Added Transparent Home Menu option (been a long time coming)

		= SelectDialog, Favourites, and Shutdown all have search icon when 
		  home window is active (superficial mostly)

	2.17.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Reverted custom home sub-menus (took too much ram for now...still gonna
		  figure it out hopefully)

		= Added Skin Variables -- doing this allowed me to add a bit of ram back by 
		  getting rid of a couple includes files
			
			--> Includes_BreadcrumbSettings.xml
			--> Includes_RamSavingBackgrounds.xml
			
		= Cleaned up custom submenu strings...
		
		= Fixed backgrounds for Keyboard and Select dialogs for particular situations 
		  (sometimes these windows backgrounds would be mostly transparent when they
		  weren't supposed to be)
		 
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

1.29.14 Version 3.5.1


	2.2.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= ADDED CUSTOM HOME MENU ITEM SUBMENUS


	1.29.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= entering skin into SVN (should be easer to update now)

		= cleaned up all comments that were unecessary (800kb to be exact)

		= ADDED Scripts home menu item...turned off by default for now, if you
		  would like it on the home screen go into skin settings and turn it on
		  under skin settings/home

		= FIXED custom home category favorites selection (favourites weren't 
		  showing up but now they are)

		= made FileBrowser icons view (when searching for pics) match the rest
		  of the icon view changes that I've made

		= FIXED ShutDownMenu "shutdown" button.  It wasn't working properly,
		  wasn't showing all of the shutdown times (30,60,120,custom) and now
		  has arrows when focused and also a reminder when the system will turn
		  off when this window is open

1.19.14 Version 3.5.0


	1.19.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Theme Textures (Lime VideoOSD)
		
		= Fixed a background issue in the video library where video playing in 
		  the background was causing the screen to be blank.

		= Fixed animation issues in video/music playlists where the background
  		  from the active window wasn't fading out completely

		= Added "selected" color highlighting for ViewModes/SortMethods

		= Fixed the "YEAR" sort method...actually all working properly now 

		= Fixed custom favourites - screen was blank while adding favourites to
	          custom submenus (thanks fxmech)

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.18.13 Version 3.3.33


	11.18.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL COMMON VIEWS!  All LIST, ICON, and BIG-ICON views have 
		  been updated skin-wide.  Pretty much a vanity revamp for Icon and Big
		  Icon, but for all non-library LIST views I added some features that 
		  should be appealing to most.  Hide the mini list icons, added button 
		  selector color (reversable by user), and the star rating is now able to 
		  be hidden.  One note for the list views, all non-library list views
		  are linked...if you change settings in music it will carry over to 
		  programs or video etc...

		= got around to adding a highlight to the top breadcrumb bar when the 
		  system tray or home icons have focus...even I was having some troubles
		  knowing when the focus was up there and I've been modding this thing.
		  Long time coming I think ---


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

11.7.13 Version 3.3.32


	11.13.13 (3.3.322)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= REINSTATED and REVAMPED Showcase Split View for Movies (originally
		  in the skin but barely worked and was sluggish to the point of 
		  rediculousness).  Went through and made the animations smooth,
		  put my spin on it, and tried my best to make the trailers work better	


	11.11.13 (3.3.321)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED ALL WIDE ICON VIEWS! (Movies,Tvshows,Episodes,Albums,Songs)
		
		= Fixed an issue with sorting...not sure what was going on (it was a
		  problem that must have existed before I even started this project).
		  I think I figured it out, maybe...maybe not

	11.7.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= I finally got sick of looking at the way the view options
		  and other library options on the top submenu were acting so I just 
		  redid all of them.  Animations are better, dialogs are better, and
      		  all in all the whole experience of using any of those options up 
		  up there are better overall  :)  Only problem I can't figure out
		  right now is how to make the labels not scroll and make sense in the
		  layout... 


ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

10.29.13 Version 3.3.3
	

	11.6.13  (3.3.311)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= UPDATED: Large Poster View (Movies/Seasons...only two areas it's used).
		  Plenty of options for this view too, should be able to be customized 
		  very well to a user's liking from all info to quite bare and simple 

		= Tweaked my busy anim a little bit more...still not sure about position
		  and speed/pulse/fade of animation).  Not to worry, I'll get it figured
		  out...and it's pretty neat IMO

		= Fixed a small bug with Dialog_Plugin_Settings being faded out when
        	  Progress_Dialog is visible...whoops

	11.4.13  (3.3.31)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= fixed red "global" bg...accidentally deleted the </texture> when I was
		  updating previously

		= UPDATED: ALL LIST INFO VIEWS ARE DONE (MUSIC/VIDEO LIBRARY MODE)...

		= UPDATED: MUSIC THUMBNAIL VIEW (looks super cool)

		= fixed buffer bar for DialogSeekbar...one more thing that's been 
		  buggin me for awhile now

		= fixed buffer bar for Fullscreen Movies...same as above

		= cleaned up much code base from 720p folder (I will continue doing this
		  in the hopes of adding more avail. RAM and speed skin wide)

	10.29.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= went through all "fullscreen dialogs" and made the animations and 
		  visibility correct...should be seemless at this point :)
		
		= updated themes

		= found and corrected almost every problem that's been bugging me about 
		  my work up to this point (edited 75/102 windows if that says anything)

		= revamped ShutdownMenu, DialogKeyboard, DialogSelect, NumericInput,
		  SmartPlaylistEditor/Rule, ContextMenu noticibly...many others as well

		= added navigational arrows to several windows for list's that extend 
		  their "<height>" (sorry must have never noticed those missing)		  
 		= changed many other things that I wont go into detail about, but the 
		  overall change is a major improvement toward fluency and appeal to say
		  the least...

		  also fixed several things that I missed when I first added it to my
		  zip.

		= Completely redid all of the video aspect ratio media flags (the
		  original ones just looked...well, not good to be polite)


	8.24.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		= Updated Movies Fanart View, made it possible to remove the wraplist
		  and info so that only minimal "screen garbage" is visible for better
		  viewing of the fanart (that is the point right???) Click on 
		  the "View options" button, then click "hide wraplist" and enjoy!

		= Updated Video OSD so that when you click on the subtitle button when
		  video is playing it will open XBMC Subtitles (script must be installed
		  in order to work) In case anyone was wondering, the script does work...

		= Completely changed HomeMenu "workings" (multilingual now :)

		= Added Dutch, French, German, Portugese, and Spanish languages!!!

		  the issue)

		  bugs, but it works well...especially on dev. builds)

                = started working on turning PROFILE dialogs into "windows" to follow up
		  what I have already done with several other dialogs (similar to what I
		  did with adding a source...several dialogs that make the process of 
		  logging into xbmc4xbox turned into one "profile settings" area).  After
		  these are wrapped up I think I'll be content with that aspect of this
		  skin ---
